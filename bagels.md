# Bagels

Prep Time: 30 minutes  
Cook Time: 20 minutes  
Total Time: 3 hours 20 minutes  

Makes 12 bagels

## Ingredients

### Bagels

* 296 ml water
* 4 1/2 cups bread flour (or add gluten to AP flour)
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp instant yeast

### Water

For each quart of water:

* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking soda

## Instructions

1. Combine water, flour, sugar, salt, oil, and yeast in a stand mixer with dough hook. Mix for about 8 minutes until well-developed. It can be tested by stretching it: if it tears before it stretches reasonably, it needs more development.
1. Let rise for two hours in a lightly oiled, covered bowl.
1. Divide deflated dough into 12 pieces. Shape into circles and punch out the centers at a diameter of about three centimeters.
1. Preheat the oven to 475â„‰.
1. Add brown sugar and baking soda to water in a diametrically large pot (does not need to be deep; it can even be a pan). Bring the water to a boil. Set out a rack for the wet bagels to go after cooking.
1. Cook the bagels in the water for about one minute per side. Holes can also be cooked for about 30 seconds per hemisphere.
1. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes.
