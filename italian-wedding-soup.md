# Italian Wedding Soup

Total Time: 30–40 minutes

Makes 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 2 oz grated Parmesan (or more)
- 1 tbsp + 2 tsp cornstarch, divided
- 2 tsp Italian seasoning, divided
- 2 shallots, halved, peeled, and diced
- 8 oz kale, stemmed and coarsely chopped (2 bunches)
- 24 oz ground pork
- 3 tbsp chicken base (or 10 cups of chicken broth)
- 6 oz ditalini noodles
- 4 tsp olive oil, divided
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper

## Instructions

1. Thoroughly combine ground pork, Parmesan, 2 tsp cornstarch, half the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Form into 8 large, 12 medium, or 16 small meatballs.
1. Place a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add half the olive oil and meatballs to hot pot. Cook until well-browned, 2–3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Don't clean the pan.
1. Place a pot over medium heat and add remaining olive oil and all the shallots. Additionally, transfer oil from pan to pot. Stir often until translucent, 30–60 seconds.
1. Add remaining Italian seasoning, (all) chicken base, and 10 cups water (or use broth instead of base and water). Simmer for 5 minutes.
1. Add pasta, kale, meatballs, and a pinch of salt to the soup. Combine 1 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tsp water and stir into soup. Cook until pasta is cooked.
1. Optionally garnish the soup with more Parmesan.
