# Italian Wedding Soup

Total Time: 30–40 minutes

Makes 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 24 oz ground pork
- 2 oz grated Parmesan (or more)
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 2 tsp Italian seasoning, divided
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 4 tsp olive oil, divided
- 2 shallots, halved, peeled, and diced
- 10–12 cups of chicken broth
- 6 oz ditalini noodles
- 8 oz kale, stemmed and coarsely chopped (2 bunches)

## Instructions

1. Thoroughly combine ground pork, Parmesan, cornstarch, half the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Form into small meatballs.
1. Place a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add half the olive oil and meatballs to hot pot. Cook until well-browned, 2–3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Don't clean the pan.
1. Place a pot over medium heat and add remaining olive oil and all the shallots. Additionally, transfer oil from pan to pot. Stir often until translucent, 30–60 seconds.
1. Add remaining Italian seasoning, (all) chicken base, and 10 cups water (or use broth instead of base and water). Simmer for 5 minutes.
1. Add pasta, kale, meatballs, and a pinch of salt to the soup. Cook until pasta is cooked.
1. Optionally garnish the soup with more Parmesan.
