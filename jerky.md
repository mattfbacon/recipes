# Beef Jerky

Prep time: 20 minutes  
Cook/rest time: 18 hours  
Total time: 18 hours  

Makes as much jerky as meat you put in.

## Ingredients

### Brines

#### Matt’s Brine

- 40–50g Salt (Uniodized)
- 1.5 tsp Onion powder
- 0.5 tsp Garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp Sugar

Add water to make 500ml.

#### Soy-lent (Slightly asian, not teriyaki)

- 35g Salt (Uniodized)
- 1/4 cup Soy (full salt, add 5g salt if using low salt.)
- 1.5 tsp Onion powder
- 0.5 tsp Garlic powder
- 0.5 tsp Sugar

Add water to make 500ml.

### Meat

- Top round or London broil: 5 pounds is a good amount.

## Instructions

1. Slice Top Round steak 1/8" diagonally across the grain. Of course trim all fat first. Any lean beef will work, but Top Round (London Broil sometimes) can be had for $2.50-5.00/lb and has the perfect texture.
1. Brine for 12 hours.
1. Sprinkle with Black Pepper to taste, if making peppered jerky.
1. Dry for 6–8 hours at 120 °F, or less if your oven won’t go this low. Should be like well jerky. Not too dry, not floppy.
