# Basic Homemade Bread

Prep Time: 20 minutes  
Bake Time: 30 minutes  
Total Time: 3 hours  

Makes 2 loaves

## Ingredients

* 1 package yeast
* 2 1/4 cups water (100–110 ℉) (532ml)
* 3 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp salt
* 2 tbsp canola oil
* 6 1/4 to 6 3/4 cups flour

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water (no need to wait for it to bloom, but make sure it's fully dissolved). Add the salt, oil, and 3 cups of the flour and stir. Add flour to form a soft dough.
1. Turn onto a floured surface, kneading by hand and adding flour until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl and turn to grease the top of the dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled.
1. Punch dough down and divide in half on a floured surface. Shape into loaves and place in greased 9×5 loaf pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 30–45 minutes or until doubled. Start the oven preheating at 375℉.
1. Bake for 30–35 minutes or until the center is at 190℉. Cool on a wire rack. Do not cut until it has cooled.

## Notes

A stand mixer is not necessary for this recipe and in some cases makes it more difficult. Better to knead it by hand.

The inside of an oven with its incandescent lights on is a good "warm place".
