Makes two large loaves.

## Ingredients

* 1 packet yeast
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 tbsp salt
* 2 cups water (100–110℉) (473 ml)
* 5 1/2 to 6 cups flour

## Instructions

1. Mix all the ingredients together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix, gradually adding more flour, until the dough pulls away from the bowl.
1. Knead by hand on a floured surface for 8 to 10 minutes.
1. Allow the dough to rise in a covered, greased bowl in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in size.
1. Deflate the dough, divide into two, and shape into loaves. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
1. Allow to rise on the sheet, covered and in a warm place, for 45 minutes. Near the end, preheat the oven to 425℉.
1. Spray the tops of the loaves with lukewarm water and score the bread diagonally. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown.
1. Turn the oven off and let the loaves cool directly on the rack with the door open.
