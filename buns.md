# Hamburger/Hot Dog Buns

Makes 8 medium buns

## Ingredients

- 3.5 cups/420 g AP flour
- 0.75–1 cup, 170–227 g water, lukewarm (100–110 °F, 40 °C)
- 2 tbsp, 28 g butter
- 2 large eggs, divided
- 2 tbsp, 25 g sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp yeast

## Instructions

1. Separate one of the eggs. Reserve the white for an egg wash.
1. Mix all the other ingredients and knead until smooth and soft, about 5 minutes.
1. Let rise for 1 to 2 hours until nearly doubled.
1. Deflate the dough into 8 pieces. Shape into balls.
1. Place the balls on a lightly greased baking sheet (with some kind of protection on the bottom to avoid burning the bottoms, like a double-layered sheet or a silicone baking mat) and flatten them a bit, to be about 3 inches across.
1. Let the buns rise, covered, for about an hour, until noticeably puffy. Preheat the oven to 375 °F.
1. Mix the egg white with 2 tbsp, 28 ml cold water and brush onto the buns.
1. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes until golden.
