# Crumpets 

Makes 20 crumpets

## Ingredients

- 1.5 cups water
- 1 cup milk, lukewarm
- 2 tbsp butter, melted
- 3.5 cups flour
- 1 scoop yeast
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 2 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. Mix ingredients in a bowl and beat vigorously to remove as many lumps as possible. You may want to mix the dry ingredients first, then add the wet ingredients.
1. Let the batter rest in a warm place for 1 hour.
1. Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium-low heat (about 4).
1. Create a pipeline of the following tasks (i.e., in ideal production, there always will be one crumpet in each stage):
	1. Lightly grease the crumpet ring and the area of the pan that the new crumpet will go into. Place the ring on the pan and add enough batter to fill the ring about halfway. I prefer a normal dining spoon and a two or three scoops is good. Cook like this until crumpet's sides are strong enough to support itself.
	1. Remove the ring. Cook like this until the crumpet's top is no longer liquid.
	1. Flip the crumpet. Once it's cooked through, remove it from the pan.
