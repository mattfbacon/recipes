# Pie Crust

Prep Time: 20 minutes  
Bake Time: 2 hours (at least)  
Total Time: 20 minutes  

Makes 2 crusts.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp salt
- sugar: 1 tsp for sweeter crust, 1/2 tsp for more savory
- optionally, 1/2 tsp baking soda, for flavor
- 1 cup butter (2 sticks, 227 grams), cut into half-inch cubes
- 1/2 cup ice water (likely less)

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, salt, sugar, baking soda.
1. Cut in the butter cubes in a food processor or by hand.
1. Very slowly add water, mixing thoroughly after each addition, until the dough begins to clump together.
1. Chill the dough for at least 2 hours in the fridge. (30 minutes in the freezer also works, but don't leave it for longer than that because it will become unworkable.)
