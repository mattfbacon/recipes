Makes ??? biscuits

## Ingredients

* 3 cups flour
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp baking powder
* 2 tsp sugar
* 85 grams butter, cold
* About 1 cup / 227 g whole milk, cold

## Instructions

1. 350℉ oven. Grease a baking sheet, double-layered if possible.
1. Mix flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a large bowl.
1. Work in the butter, using a fork or cooking scissors.
1. Add 1 cup of milk to the mixture and mix for about 15 seconds—don't overmix! If the dough is still dry, add more milk and mix quickly until it's cohesive.
1. Roll the dough out on a floured work surface to about 2 cm thickness. Fold in thirds like a letter and roll again to the same thickness. (A bit of flour can be added before folding if the dough is particularly wet, which will help separate the layers just a bit more.)
1. Cut dough in 6 cm circles. Keep the top up. Push the remaining dough back together after cutting out to get more biscuits; this can be done once or twice maximum. You can always bake the remaining parts even if they're not circular.
1. Flip all the biscuits so the bottom is up. Place them on the pan and brush them with milk for browning.
1. Bake for 30 minutes until lightly browned. Serve warm.
